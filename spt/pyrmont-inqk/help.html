each call to `peg/match` can be thought of
as consisting of a sequence of events
corresponding to entries into, exits out of,
and/or erroring out of a sequence of peg
"call" frames.  each spt trace consists of
a series of such events.

each event has its own html file showing
information about the event.  there are
links / shortcuts that can be used to
navigate to related event files.
